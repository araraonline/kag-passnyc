    "## How/Where do we find the targets?\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks like the main question that was provided by PASSNYC. Since our data is school-based, we must direct the efforts towards schools, not specific students. Some ideas include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find groups of schools where PASSNYC can have a great influence\n",
    "- Rank schools based on the influence that we can have on them\n",
    "- Use a low-cost strategy for finding specific targets amidst a huge environment (e.g. calling schools asking for stellar students)\n",
    "\n",
    "## How/Where does the target find us?\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems like a promising strategy. Insteading of reaching out to students, let them reach out for us. Examples of this include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Posting papers at schools\n",
    "- Presence in the internet\n",
    "- Presence in places where students would search for help. This includes physical places, knowledge among teachers or even easiness to be found on the internet (PASSNYC site ranks #5 when you search for 'how to prepare for shsat?' on Google)\n",
    "\n",
    "Through all this means, we want to reduce the effort that a student must take to reach to us. So, for example, PASSNYC site could have an appearance that is designed to help students get the resources they want.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is it that students want to go to SPHS or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is really important, because, based on it, we can know which groups would benefit most from PASSNYC and how to approach the students in a good manner. For example, some kinds of student may not want to go to SPHS because they have no condition to do so. If there is a certain kind of assistance that helps them in this area, and we point it, the number of undeserved students taking SHSAT may increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important thing here is: know thy problems, and then, you can tackle them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is it that students want to take SHSAT or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is somewhat close to the last one. One thing I want to note is that, right now, there hasn't been much focus on the 'why' of the things. Instead, what we know is 'who' takes the SHSAT or not. This is pretty clearly demonstrated by the demographics of SPHS. But 'why' is a more specific question, and it could only be answered with specific research towards it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What our targets could mostly benefit from?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question reveals what I believe is the essence of PASSNYC. Building a repository of what students could mostly benefit from and guiding them to a nice directions seems to be what PASSNYC does. Like a traffic cop pointing directions. Some things that would help in this area:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand general student needs, but also,\n",
    "- Have people that communicate with students to understand specific needs\n",
    "- Have a good list of resources that is easily scanned through\n",
